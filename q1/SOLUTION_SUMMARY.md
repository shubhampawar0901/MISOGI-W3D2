### Key Components

1. **Provider System**: Modular design with abstract base class for easy extension
2. **Configuration Management**: YAML-based config with environment variable support
3. **Concurrent Processing**: Parallel API calls for faster comparisons
4. **Rich CLI**: Beautiful terminal interface with tables and progress indicators
5. **Visualization**: Matplotlib/Seaborn charts for performance analysis
6. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with graceful degradation

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Interactive Mode
```bash
python main.py --interactive
```

### Single Query
```bash
python main.py --query "Explain quantum computing" --model-type instruct --provider openai
```

### With Visualization
```bash
python main.py --query "Write a poem" --visualize
```

## 📊 Key Features

### Model Comparison Capabilities

## 📈 Sample Results

The tool has been tested with diverse prompts including:
1. Technical explanations (quantum computing)
2. Creative writing (robot emotion story)
3. Mathematical problems (speed calculations)
4. Analytical tasks (renewable energy pros/cons)
5. Code generation tasks

Results show clear differences between model types:
- **Instruct models**: Better at following specific instructions
- **Base models**: More creative but less predictable
- **Fine-tuned models**: Specialized for particular domains

## 🎯 Key Insights from Comparisons

### Model Type Characteristics
