Q: 3
🔧 Problem 3: Build a Tool-Enhanced Reasoning Script
Create a Python script that takes natural language queries and uses an LLM to:

Interpret the query using chain-of-thought (CoT) style reasoning
Call external tools (e.g., a calculator function or string counter) when necessary
Combine results to produce a final answer
The script should decide when a tool is needed (based on prompt output) and call the appropriate function.

Example queries:

“What’s the square root of the average of 18 and 50?”
“How many vowels are in the word ‘Multimodality’?”
“Is the number of letters in ‘machine’ greater than the number of vowels in ‘reasoning’?”
🧠 Key Concepts:
Tool-calling with LLMs (manual implementation via string parsing or function mapping)
Prompt-based reasoning (CoT prompting)
Decision logic (basic if-else based on LLM outputs)
🏗️ Requirements:
You don’t need agents, LangChain, or frameworks
Tools (like calculator, string counter) should be functions
Use OpenAI API or any open LLM API to generate reasoning steps
Output should include:
The LLM’s reasoning step
Whether a tool was used
The final answer

Push your code to a GitHub repository

Structure:


├── main.py
├── tools/
│   ├── math_tools.py

Your README.md should include:

How to install and run the script
Examples of at least 5 test queries and their output
A note on how your prompt helps decide tool usage
Provide API key instructions in .env.example
