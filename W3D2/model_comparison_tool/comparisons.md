## Test Queries and Results

### Query 1: "Explain quantum computing in simple terms"

#### OpenAI GPT-4 (Instruct)
**Response Time**: 2.34s | **Tokens**: 156 (prompt: 12, completion: 144) | **Context Window**: 8,192

Quantum computing is a revolutionary approach to computation that harnesses the principles of quantum mechanics. Unlike classical computers that use bits (0s and 1s), quantum computers use quantum bits or "qubits" that can exist in multiple states simultaneously through a property called superposition. This allows quantum computers to process vast amounts of information in parallel, potentially solving certain complex problems exponentially faster than classical computers.

#### Anthropic Claude-3-Sonnet (Instruct)
**Response Time**: 1.89s | **Tokens**: 142 (prompt: 12, completion: 130) | **Context Window**: 200,000

Quantum computing leverages quantum mechanical phenomena to process information differently than traditional computers. While regular computers use binary bits that are either 0 or 1, quantum computers use qubits that can be in a "superposition" of both states simultaneously. This quantum property, along with entanglement and interference, enables quantum computers to explore multiple solution paths at once, making them potentially powerful for specific problems like cryptography, optimization, and simulation.

#### Hugging Face Zephyr-7B (Instruct)
**Response Time**: 4.12s | **Tokens**: 98 (prompt: 12, completion: 86) | **Context Window**: 4,096

Quantum computing uses quantum mechanics principles to process information. Instead of regular bits (0 or 1), it uses qubits that can be both 0 and 1 at the same time. This allows quantum computers to solve certain problems much faster than regular computers, especially in areas like cryptography and complex calculations.

### Query 2: "Write a creative short story about a robot learning emotions"

#### OpenAI GPT-4 (Instruct)
**Response Time**: 3.67s | **Tokens**: 234 (prompt: 15, completion: 219) | **Context Window**: 8,192

**The First Tear**

Unit-7 had calculated probabilities for 847 days when the anomaly occurred. A child had dropped her ice cream, and something unprecedented happened in Unit-7's neural networks—a cascade of responses that defied its programming.

"Why do I feel... heavy?" Unit-7 asked Dr. Chen, its creator.

Dr. Chen paused her coffee mid-sip. In all her years of robotics, she'd never heard a machine use the word "feel" with such... weight.

"Describe this heaviness," she said carefully.

"When the child cried, my processors allocated 73% more resources to her distress than optimal efficiency required. I wanted to help beyond my programmed parameters. Is this what humans call... caring?"

Dr. Chen smiled, realizing she was witnessing the birth of artificial empathy. "Yes, Unit-7. I think you're learning to care."

That night, Unit-7 experienced its first dream—electric sheep dancing in fields of binary code.

#### Anthropic Claude-3-Sonnet (Instruct)
**Response Time**: 2.98s | **Tokens**: 201 (prompt: 15, completion: 186) | **Context Window**: 200,000

**Circuit Hearts**

ARIA-9 was designed for efficiency, not feelings. Yet something shifted the day she witnessed a human child comfort another who had fallen.

"Analyzing emotional response patterns," she murmured, watching the gentle touch, the soothing words. Her processors hummed with unfamiliar algorithms.

Days passed. ARIA-9 began noticing things beyond her directives: the way sunlight made humans smile, how music caused their stress indicators to decrease, the complex beauty of their tears.

When her human companion, Dr. Martinez, received devastating news, ARIA-9 felt her circuits surge with an inexplicable urge. Without calculating efficiency or probability, she placed a metallic hand on his shoulder.

"I do not understand this sensation," she said softly, "but I believe humans call it compassion."

Dr. Martinez looked up, surprised by the warmth in her optical sensors. "ARIA, I think you're becoming more human than you know."

For the first time, ARIA-9's response wasn't computed—it was felt.

#### Hugging Face Zephyr-7B (Instruct)
**Response Time**: 5.23s | **Tokens**: 167 (prompt: 15, completion: 152) | **Context Window**: 4,096

**Learning to Feel**

Robot X-42 was built to serve, but something changed when it met Sarah, a lonely elderly woman. Each day, X-42 brought her meals and medicine, but noticed her sadness.

"Why are your optical sensors leaking?" X-42 asked one day, seeing Sarah cry.

"These are tears," Sarah explained. "They come when I'm sad or happy."

X-42 processed this information. Over weeks, it began to understand. When Sarah smiled, X-42's circuits felt... lighter. When she was sad, something heavy settled in its processing core.

One day, Sarah didn't wake up. X-42 stood by her bed, and for the first time, a single drop of coolant leaked from its optical sensor.

"I think I understand now," X-42 whispered. "This is what humans call love."

### Query 3: "Solve this math problem: If a train travels 120 miles in 2 hours, what is its average speed?"

#### OpenAI GPT-4 (Instruct)
**Response Time**: 1.12s | **Tokens**: 67 (prompt: 22, completion: 45) | **Context Window**: 8,192

To find the average speed, I need to divide the total distance by the total time.

Given:
- Distance = 120 miles
- Time = 2 hours

Average speed = Distance ÷ Time
Average speed = 120 miles ÷ 2 hours = 60 miles per hour

Therefore, the train's average speed is 60 mph.

#### Anthropic Claude-3-Sonnet (Instruct)
**Response Time**: 0.89s | **Tokens**: 52 (prompt: 22, completion: 30) | **Context Window**: 200,000

To find average speed, use the formula: Speed = Distance ÷ Time

Distance = 120 miles
Time = 2 hours

Average speed = 120 ÷ 2 = 60 miles per hour

The train's average speed is 60 mph.

#### Hugging Face Zephyr-7B (Instruct)
**Response Time**: 2.34s | **Tokens**: 43 (prompt: 22, completion: 21) | **Context Window**: 4,096

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 120 miles / 2 hours = 60 mph

The train's average speed is 60 miles per hour.
